[Raymond Chen](https://twitter.com/ChenCravat)'s blog, "[The Old New Thing](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/)" is an interesting blog and I recommend checking it out from time to time, it looks like he often dives into the unknown and gives some insights.

The big thing for me is the series he did on the [Intel 80386](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_80386) as they are easy for me to read and follow. Even if you already know assembly you might enjoy the read as you may still learn a thing or two and I highly recommend checking it out:
