This summer (2019) I participated in Cyber FastTrack, a online cybersecurity course. Last Friday I found out I was one of the finalist, meaning I got a full scholarship to the [SANS Technology Institute's Undegraduate Certificate in Applied Cybersecurity.](https://www.sans.edu/academics/undergraduate) Big accomplishment.

To find out more about the Cyber FastTrack program go to [cyber-fasttrack.org](https://www.cyber-fasttrack.org)

Here is a post with all the finalists and a little bit of what it took to get there:

Eventually I will like to do a nice write up of my experience, time is against me, but sooner or later I'll get there!
