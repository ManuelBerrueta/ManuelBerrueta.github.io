While in a much needed vacation I was looking at a PCAP for a CTF style challenge and while performing some research I found a few resources that might come in handy in the future and I thought I would share them.

PacketTotal is sorta like a VirusTotal for packets and it can help you identify suspicious & strange activity and will also show similar packets. Just like VirusTotal, once you upload it, it becomes public, so beware probably don't want to upload anything sensitive / private.

Using elasticsearch and Kibana to analyze network packets, not something I necessarily needed or used, but something that might come in handy in the future!

PCAS - Project PCAP File Analysis Guide. It breaks down common protocols and some packet analysis basics.
