I was doing some research on Windows authentication, in particular Active Directory and Domain Controller authentication. I was interested in Security Access Token (SAT) and Security ID (SID) Numbers..

I was interested in how to get this information and I found a few resources to do it:

1. whoami /all
2. Process Hacker
