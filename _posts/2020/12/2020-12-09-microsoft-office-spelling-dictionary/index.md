I tend to do a lot of reports for work as well as school and every now and then when I get a misspelling, I click "Add to Dictionary" accidentally rather than selecting the right word.

I went on a quick quest to figure out how to erase them and here it is:

- Go to "C:\\Users\\<UserName>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Microsoft\\Spelling\\en-US"
- Here there will be a few different files, in my case I selected "default.dic" and opened with notepad.
- Here you should see all the words that you have added. Simply erase the ones you don't want and save it!

Pretty simple, I hope this helps you.
